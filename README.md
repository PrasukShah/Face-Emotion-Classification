# Face-Emotion-Classification

This repository contains code and resources for classifying facial expressions into different emotion categories using machine learning techniques. Emotion classification from facial expressions plays a significant role in various applications including human-computer interaction, sentiment analysis, and affective computing.

## Overview

The project focuses on building a machine learning model capable of accurately detecting emotions from facial images. The model is trained on labeled datasets containing images of faces annotated with corresponding emotion labels. It leverages state-of-the-art techniques in computer vision and deep learning to extract features from facial images and classify them into predefined emotion categories.

## Key Features

- **Data Preprocessing:** Includes preprocessing techniques such as face detection, alignment, and normalization to ensure consistency and improve model performance.
- **Model Architecture:** Utilizes deep learning architectures like Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) or pretrained models such as VGG, ResNet, or MobileNet to learn discriminative features from facial images.
- **Training and Evaluation:** Provides scripts for training the model on labeled datasets and evaluating its performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
- **Deployment:** Offers guidance on deploying the trained model in real-world applications, including integration with web or mobile applications.
